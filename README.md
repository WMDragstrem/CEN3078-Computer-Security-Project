# CEN3078-Computer-Security-Project
A simple text-based program developed for my Programming 2 final under Professor Allen. \
The scope is rather limited due to Hurricane Ian hitting prior to its assignment.
\
The main file is ShapesProject.cpp, the rest are all its header files.

## Ver 1.2.0
*One new feature added for this update to the ShapesProject.cpp file* \
\
Program now accepts integers, rather than chars as input, reducing the risk of code injection and allowing the usage of enums for better future-proofing.\
